    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive educational tool, not a linear report. The structure guides the user from a high-level concept to specific examples and self-assessment. It begins with a definition (Header), moves to an interactive 'Verb Explorer' where users can select specific verbs to see their missing forms and examples, followed by a 'Visual Comparison' chart to graphically show what "defective" means. It then provides a textual explanation ('Why are they Defective?') and concludes with a 'Quick Quiz' for knowledge reinforcement. This non-linear, exploratory structure was chosen because it allows users to learn at their own pace, focusing on the verbs they find most challenging, making the grammatical concept more digestible and engaging than a simple text document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Report Info: Definition of defective verbs. -> Goal: Inform. -> Presentation: Header text. -> Interaction: None. -> Justification: Clear, immediate introduction. -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind.
        - Report Info: List of defective verbs and their missing conjugations/forms. -> Goal: Organize, Compare. -> Presentation: An interactive verb explorer with buttons for each verb, a "conjugation card" (HTML Grid) showing available vs. unavailable forms (using '❌'), and example sentences. -> Interaction: User clicks a button to dynamically update the display with the selected verb's data. -> Justification: This is the core interactive element. It breaks down the complex topic into manageable pieces and makes the abstract idea of "missing forms" concrete and specific to each verb. -> Library/Method: JS data object, DOM manipulation.
        - Report Info: The concept of "fewer forms" compared to regular verbs. -> Goal: Compare. -> Presentation: A vertical bar chart. -> Interaction: Hover tooltips. -> Justification: A chart provides a powerful, at-a-glance visualization of the core concept, making it immediately understandable. -> Library/Method: Chart.js/Canvas.
        - Report Info: Explanations for why verbs are defective. -> Goal: Inform. -> Presentation: Titled text sections. -> Interaction: None. -> Justification: Provides necessary background context after the user has explored the "what." -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Rules of usage. -> Goal: Engage, Assess. -> Presentation: A multiple-choice quiz. -> Interaction: User selects an answer and receives immediate feedback. -> Justification: Actively engages the user and allows them to test their understanding, reinforcing learning. -> Library/Method: JS data array, DOM manipulation.

Click on a verb from the list below to see a detailed breakdown of its functions, which forms it's missing (its "defects"), and examples of correct and incorrect usage. This hands-on approach makes it easier to grasp the unique characteristics of each verb.

                To understand what "defective" really means, it's helpful to see a comparison. This chart illustrates the stark difference in the number of available grammatical forms between a regular, complete verb like "to walk" and a typical defective modal verb like "can". The limited range of the defective verb is its defining feature.

             <p class="text-center text-stone-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                The "defectiveness" of these verbs isn't an error; it's a result of their linguistic history and function. They evolved from main verbs in Old and Middle English into the specialized auxiliary (helper) verbs we use today. This section explains the primary reasons behind their limited forms.

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3 text-stone-800">Specialized Function</h3>
                    <p>Modal verbs like <strong>can, must,</strong> and <strong>will</strong> serve a very specific grammatical purpose: to add information about modality (such as possibility, necessity, or permission) to a main verb. They don't express actions themselves. Because they always accompany a main verb in its base form (e.g., "I <span class='text-red-600'>can</span> <strong>go</strong>"), they don't need forms like infinitives (<em>to can</em>) or participles (<em>canning</em>).</p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3 text-stone-800">Historical Evolution</h3>
                    <p>Many of these verbs are remnants of a class of verbs in Old English (called preterite-present verbs) whose past tense forms took on a present tense meaning. This unusual history led to them having an incomplete set of conjugations. As English evolved, their roles became more fixed as helpers, and they never developed a full set of modern verb forms.</p>
